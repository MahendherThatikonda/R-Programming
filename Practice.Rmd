## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/lenovo/Desktop/STAT 462 Data Mining/Week_5")
```

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)
```

For this lab, we are going to work with Boston Dataset,

```{r}
Boston
```

```{r}
df_boston <- Boston %>% 
  mutate(medv_new = case_when(medv >= median(medv) ~ 1,
                             medv < median(medv) ~ 0))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_boston, aes(x = rm, y = factor(medv_new))) + 
  geom_jitter(shape = 21, alpha = 0.75, size = 3, height=0.1) +
  scale_y_discrete(name = "medv_new",
                   labels = c("0(Low)", "1(High)"))

```

Now we have to calculate the Probability $Pr(medv\_new =1|rm)$

The probability of being Class 1 is

$g_1(x) =\mathbb P(G=1|X=x) = \frac{\exp(b_0+b_1 x)}{1+\exp(b_0+b_1 x)}$

Now the probability of being class 0 is

$g_0(x)=\mathbb P(G=0|X=x) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(b_0+b_1 x)}$

Now we have to find the optimal pair of b0 and b1 from the training set, ##Setup first split the dataset into a training and test set in the ratio of 80:20

```{r}
nrow(Boston)
set.seed(12)
sampl_iter <- sample(1:nrow(Boston),0.8*nrow(Boston))
df_boston_train <- df_boston[sampl_iter,]
df_boston_test <- df_boston[-sampl_iter,]
```

```{r}
df_boston_train
```

```{r}
df_boston_test
```

## Now we estimate coefficients by Hand,

we try to find $\hat b_0$ and $\hat b_1$ such that estimated $\hat {g_1(x)}$ yields a number closer to 1 for "High" *medv_new* and a number closer to 0 for low *medv_new*.This can be formalized into a likelihood function

\$\$\$\$\\begin{split}\\ell(b_0,b_1) &= \\prod\_{i=1}\^n \\left[ g_1(x_i; b_0, b_1) \\right]\^{y_i} \\cdot \\left[ 1 - g_1(x_i; b_0, b_1) \\right]\^{1-y_i} \\\\ &= \\prod\_{i: y_i=1}g_1(x_i; b_0, b_1) \\cdot \\prod\_{i: y_i=0} (1 - g_1(x_i; b_0, b_1))\\end{split}\$\$\$\$

```         
The pair that maximises $\ell(b_0,b_1)$ is the optimal value $(\hat b_0,\hat b_1)$ we are looking for
```

```         
If we apply logarithm to both side of the likelihood function, we get: $$ \log(\ell(b_0,b_1)) = \sum_i (y_i(b_0 + b_1 x_i) - \log\left(1 + \exp(b_0 + b_1 x_i)\right))$$
```

$$
\log(\ell(b_0,b_1)) = \sum_i (y_i(b_0 + b_1 x_i) - \log\left(1 + \exp(b_0 + b_1 x_i)\right))
$$

```         
We can use the function `optim()` in R to search the optimal coefficients, for example: if we want to find the $x$ that would return the optimal value for $f(x) = x^2-2x+1$ and we start searching from $x=-500$ 
```

$f(x) = x^2-2x+1$ and we start searching for $x=-500$
```{r}
func <- function(x) {  
  x^2 - 2 * x + 1
}
```

```{r}
result <- optim(par = -500, fn = func, method = "BFGS")
```
The best set of parameters can be found through `result$par`
```{r}
result$par
```

Notice that, `optim()` performs the minimisation by default, if we want to find the maximiser for our likelihood function, we can either set `fnscale` a negative value in `control` list (see `?optim()`) or apply negation to our log-likelihood and then search for minimum.

```{r}
result <- optim(par = -500, fn = func, method = "BFGS",control = list(fnscale = -1))
?optim
result$par
```

```{r}
negloglikelihood <- function(b){
  # explanatory variable
  x = df_boston_train$rm
  # response variable
  y = df_boston_train$medv_new
  
  # likelihood function value
  -sum(y*(b[1]+b[2]*x) - log(1+exp(b[1] + b[2])))
}

res <- optim(par = c(0, 0), fn = negloglikelihood(), gr = NULL, method = 'BFGS')
x <- 5
```
